1- Collision handling

This is the main problem of the project.
Between sprites and sprite groups their behavings are not handled smoothly.
Our best successful atempt is the Shooter-Mushroom collision case.
TODO: 
    after we figure out how to handle sprite collisions, smoothly:
    Fix Shooter-Mushroom collision. Mushrooms must be obstacle for the shooter.
    Centipede-Mushroom: on hit reverse the dx value of the Centipede.
    Spider-Mushroom: Spiders can eat the mushrooms.
    Spider-Shooter: -1 live to player.

2- Spider is not chasing the player

Need to calculate distance between the player and the shooter, after this spider should create a few
waypoints and follow these waypoints to get player. We didn't implement drawing a line to player and then
a spider following this line. Instead of this, spider spawns on left to the screen or right then wanders
to the opposite direction.

3- Refactoring sprite speeds.

For more enjoyable game experience.

4- Scoreboard on the top of the screen, including remaining lives of player.

5-Movement of the player

Currently, program can't handle moving the player on NW, NE, SW, SE directions. For example if the player
wants to go up-left direction, they need to press up arrow key, then to left arrow key. If they press 
simultaneously, program can't handle this input.

6- Centipede after hit

After hit, centipede needs to spawn a mushroom on the point where it's hit, and it needs to split in two
recursively.

7- Stages

In main, we only increased the centipede speed for difficulty. We can add additional monsters and like in
Atari's centipede we can move the centipede vertically.

8- Spiders spawn to quick, somehow need to set a time interval. pygame’s set timer method won’t work.

9- Main code

Things are just too spaghetti in main.
